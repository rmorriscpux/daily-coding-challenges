Describe and give an example of each of the following types of polymorphism:

    Ad-hoc polymorphism
    - Multiple methods with the same name but with different types/amounts of parameters.
    - ex: myFunction(integer), myFunction(integer, string), myFunction(integer, integer) as separate implementations.

    Parametric polymorphism
    - Allows for generic typing within complex objects, so a method can work on any type.
    - ex: list methods that can act on any type, such as my_list.append(), my_list.pop(), etc.

    Subtype polymorphism
    - The ability for a method to act on a child class object in the same manner as its parent class.
    - ex: class Square extends Rectangle, myFunction(Rectangle) can accept a Square object as its parameter.
