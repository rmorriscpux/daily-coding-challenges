Describe what happens when you type a URL into your browser and press Enter.

    1. The browser gets the host IP matching the URL from either its resolution cache or the DNS.
    2. If the host is found, an HTTP GET request is sent to the host server.
    3. The host responds with the file(s) relevant to the URL or an error message.
    4. The browser renders the HTML file in the window, if applicable.
